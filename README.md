# Poke-GPT

- Uses OpenAIs ChatGPT API and PokeAPI to simulate random pokemon battles given two random pokemon, each with 4 different moves randomly selected from their move list
- Eventually want to add selection of pokemon and moves
- Relies on an active OpenAI account, as there is no free tier to their API use anymore. Page is currently not active for this reason
